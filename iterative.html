Through our work, Warp sought to streamline user setup and minimize the time needed to determine if the product was right for them.</div>

I went through the downloading and onboarding process and took notes about what features made sense and what I found particularly confusing. We reached out to the design team and asked for clarifications on company jargon and the motivation of the product. We broadened our research to consider how other companies handled their onboarding experience and what enjoyable and reliable experiences we could implement in our revised onboarding prototype.</div>

One design was relatively straightforward, while the other was more far-fetched and elaborate. We spent a lot of time analyzing and determining what features made the most sense from each of our sketches to include in the final development. Specifically, from my research and sketching, we decided to incorporate hidden but distinctive features that were missing in the onboarding experience, such as the Warp drive and the AI features.</div>

            <div class="sub-text" id="lo-text">After discussing which features to incorporate, we designed our first low-fi wireframe. We adjusted the login process to differentiate the text of logging in and signing up. We also moved the sign-up screen and marketing survey into the Warp terminal app itself but kept these features separate models. Our goal was to keep these two components together but be distinct from the command-line interaction within the terminal. We adjusted the marketing survey to remove the user's need to click the "Next" button in the survey and instead replaced it with an automatic advance of the questions. We decided to keep the "in-blocklist" experience once the user reaches the terminal, meaning the appearance of a typical scrolling command-by-command terminal UI with the addition of selectable blocks. We expanded on Warp's existing configuration steps to allow users to select their shell to reduce confusion about porting over their existing setup. We then walked through Warp's features: we attempted to balance existing onboarding components and introduce different features to promote the app's uniqueness.</div>

We also shared with our fellow peers to receive advice on our general formatting and sketches. The main critiques from non-warp users were rooted in design: removing unnecessary whitespace and keeping each frame in the wireframe consistent with the actual user process of the “in-blocklist” design. We also received advice to mark a user’s progress in the marketing survey or the entire onboarding experience to keep users engaged and up-to-date on the timing of the process. Lastly, our client expressed their interest in having the marketing survey moved into the “blocklist” structure in the terminal.

We split up the frames to develop, organize, and flesh out the login/sign-up flow into the marketing survey in the “blocklist” design, moving to allow users to choose their configurations. From here, the experience delves into the unique features, talking about creating commands, demonstrating a user’s drive, and the inventive ideas of AI incorporation. I specifically focused on including the features that were not previously highlighted, such as the Drive and AI. I looked at how these features were previously presented to users and moved to adapt these ideas into the onboarding process. We took these ideas and elaborated them into a high-fi prototype.</div>
