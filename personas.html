In this case, vending machines are intended to be easy and intuitive, providing affordable and quick food or beverages. They exist all over public spaces but are largely used on college campuses to provide a time-efficient solution to grabbing a bite to eat.

        <div class="sub-text">While vending machines are widely used, insinuating intuitive use among many individuals, I <span class="bold">observed</span> this common technical product to understand users' needs. I conducted <span class="bold">user interviews</span> to locate target users and gather empirical observations about the product's usability. I applied these observations to <span class="bold">create personas</span> that would use the product, ultimately leading to a <span class="bold">storyboard</span> to visualize a user's process.</div>

         <div class="sub-text" id="understanding-text">To better understand the product’s features, I sketched the design, including all integral components and pieces of machinery. I labeled and described each element to understand the importance and relationship of different pieces.

          <div class="sub-title">OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH</div>
          <div class="sub-text" id="observation-text"> I observed students using a snack vending machine at a Brown University library to gather ideas about the target user and their experience. I silently watched their purchasing process and followed up with unbiased questions about their experience.</div>
          <div class="sub-text" id="additional-text">Their ordering process had little variance with a linear timeline:</div>

          <div class="sub-title">FINDINGS</div>
            <div class="first-row">
                <div class="sub-text" id="first-text">The three students I interviewed said they used the machine to grab a quick snack before diving into their studies. They mentioned the <span class="bold">closeness</span> of the food and the <span class="bold">convenience</span> of not having to leave the building to go to a dining hall to get something to eat. They also discussed the <span class="bold">affordability</span> and advantages of cheap products.</div>

          <div class="sub-text" id="second-row-text">The main recurring ideas were comments on the unappealing aesthetic of the machinery or the need for instructions or diagrams. The users mentioned the design was clean but unexciting and ugly. They were not particularly drawn to the product due to its style and layout; they were more interacting with the machine for the end result and the lack of a similar, better-designed product.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="third-row">
          <div class="sub-text" id="first-text">These users had succumbed to the boring, if not unattractive, design by lacking improvements or revisions for the product. However, a user was practically scarred from her first experience with the equipment: she was unsure of the order of steps to purchase a product. She was pretty confused with how the buttons and different components worked together. She said she spent what felt like “15 hours” trying to figure out the instructions and get her vending machine item. Her lack of familiarity with the UI impeded her usage and made her more hesitant to recommend or use the product again.</div>
