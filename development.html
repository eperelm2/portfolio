      <div class="overview">Many people say that no product is original or unique. While many products tackle similar issues, it is important to conduct analyses of competitive companies to understand a product’s unique impact, both positive and negative, on users. Through my functional aggregator interface, Simple Spotify, I was able to apply competitive analysis findings of aggregating interfaces to design an efficient and usable product.</div>

        <div class="sub-text">I began to construct a competitive analysis by thinking about companies that utilized similar aggregator functions. I investigated Spotify, Amazon, and Gmail and their processes of favoriting an item or adding it to a cart. I considered how these companies organizes their features and how a a user adds to the list, removes from the list, or can filter and sort through the list. After exploration and research, I captured my discoveries in a competitive analysis diagram, focusing on the different features implemented by the competitive companies.</div>

            <div class="sub-title">RESULTS</div>
            <div class="sub-text">The competitive analysis shared that two of the three websites did not include an indicating icon to show that an item had been included in the aggregated list. The lack of this identification feature adds a layer of difficulty and confusion for the user about whether the item already exists in the list. Only two of the applications allow a user to filter through the aggregated list; the use of filtering increases a user’s effectiveness and organization of their aggregated list. These competing companies handle recommendations for adding to the aggregated list differently. For example, a recommendation algorithm for starring an email would likely not be helpful because only highly trained, processed, and individualistic models would be able to predict what a user would find helpful or worthy of a star. Additionally, Gmail and Amazon apply conceptual models to demonstrate physical objects that users would rely on to perform the virtual actions in real life, such as the envelope icon and the shopping cart.</div>

                    <div class="sub-text">I consolidated my findings to brainstorm ideas for an interface focusing on favoriting songs, filtering based on the rating or the genre, and sorting based on the length of a song. I knew I wanted to clearly indicate when an item had been added or removed from the favorites list to remove user confusion. I was also sure that I wanted to be able to see the contents of the aggregated list while being able to add and remove from it simultaneously. This feature allows users to immediately see the impact of their actions and how it has affected the aggregated list. Lastly, I considered the importance of visual awareness surrounding the features that could be filtered or sorted on to allow for efficient user practice.</div>

            <div class="sub-text">I took my competitive analysis and conceptual ideas to create a clean and organized interface that demonstrates filtering, sorting, and aggregating abilities. I designed a dashboard holding a list of song cards, containing their cover photo, artist, title, length, rating (out of 5 stars), and genre. I have two filterable categories that allow filtering based on the rating of the songs and the song’s genre. I created a sorting functionality that organizes the song cards based the respective song’s length. Each song has the ability to be favorited and added to the aggregator list. A user can see how many songs are in the favorites list, as well as the songs’ titles and lengths, and can remove the songs from this list. The song card itself also displays if the item is in the aggregated list via the heart icon; the user can click this button on a song’s card to add or remove the song from the favorites list.</div>

            <div class="sub-text">Through the research process, I was able to enhance my abilities to evaluate competitive companies and create a competitive analysis. I took this exploration to find benefits as well as disadvantages within competing companies using similar solutions. I utilized my findings to brainstorm a design and interface that allows a user to add, remove, filter, and sort from an aggregated list. In addition, I continued to develop my React skills when creating an interactive interface that has interconnected components.</div>
