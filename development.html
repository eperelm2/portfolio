      <div class="overview">Many people say that no product is original or unique. While many products tackle similar issues, it is important to conduct analyses of competitive companies to understand a product’s unique impact, both positive and negative, on users. Through my functional aggregator interface, Simple Spotify, I was able to apply competitive analysis findings of aggregating interfaces to design an efficient and usable product.</div>

        <div class="sub-text" id="rivalaries-text">To find the uniqueness of competing companies, I began researching organizations that utilized similar aggregator functions: Spotify, Amazon, and Gmail. I considered how these companies organize their features to <span class=bold>add to</span> a favorites list or shopping cart, <span class=bold>remove from</span> the list, or <span class=bold>filter and sort</span> through the list. After exploration and research, I captured my discoveries in a competitive analysis diagram, focusing on the different features implemented by competitive companies.</div>

            <div class="sub-text" id="results-text">The competitive analysis shares that two websites did not include an icon indicating that an item had been added to the aggregated list. The lack of this identification adds confusion for the user about whether the item already exists in the list. Only two applications allow a user to filter through the aggregated list; filtering increases a user’s effectiveness and organization of their aggregated list. These competing companies handle recommendations for adding to the aggregated list differently. Additionally, Gmail and Amazon apply conceptual models to demonstrate physical objects that users would rely on to perform virtual actions in real life, such as the envelope icon and the shopping cart.</div>

I learned I wanted to indicate when an item had been added or removed from the favorites list to limit user confusion. I also wanted to see the contents of the aggregated list while being able to add and remove from it simultaneously. Lastly, I considered the importance of visual awareness surrounding the features that could be filtered or sorted to allow for efficient user practice.</div>

            <div class="sub-text" id="end-text">I took my competitive analysis and conceptual ideas to create a clean and organized interface that demonstrates filtering, sorting, and aggregating abilities. I designed a dashboard holding a list of song cards containing their cover photo, artist, title, length, rating (out of 5 stars), and genre. I have two filterable categories that allow filtering based on the rating of the songs and the song’s genre. I created a sorting functionality that organizes the song cards based on the respective song’s length. Each song can be favorited and added to the aggregator list. A user can see how many songs are in the favorites list, as well as the songs’ titles and lengths, and can remove the songs from this list. The song card itself also displays if the item is in the aggregated list via the heart icon; the user can click this button on a song’s card to add or remove the song from the favorites list.</div>
